OBSERVATION:
All the Class were not properly arranged.

RECOMMENDATION:
I will recommend a well folder structure (Package) where the necessary classes can be found. for readability.

OBSERVATION ON CUSTOMER CLASS:
The Customer class was well arranged with all the necessary components required for JPA entity.

RECOMMENDATION:

I will recommend the use of Lombok annotation, to reduce the boilerplate code in the classes and repetitive of the getter,setter and the rest.

OBSERVATION ON CUSTOMER MAIN CLASS:
A Spring Boot main class should  serve as the entry point of your Spring Boot application.
which is supposed to contains essential information and configurations to bootstrap and run your application.


RECOMMENDATION:
I will recommend to create a separate controller class which will be used for routing. un necessary commented code should be removed .


CONCLUSION:
Applying these recommendations will lead to substantial enhancements in code organization, maintainability, and alignment with industry-standard software engineering practices.
